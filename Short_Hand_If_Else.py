# Short Hand If else
# Short hand conditionals are also known as one liners
# they are used to write the code in one line
# make code short
# but they are not redable proberly so they are not recommended for long and compplex code

# lets try some examples
# example 1
a = 3
b = 4
# a normal program to print statement
if a > b:
    print("A is greater")
else:
    print("b is greater ")

# now writing the same program as one liner

print("a is greater")if a > b else print("b is greater ")


# and another example is like

num1 = int(input("Enter number: "))
if num1 > 5: print("Ohk")
