# List in python
# list in python are the storage of data in python
# list can be mioxed means we can add different different data in the list like str and int together and so on
# it is like array in other programming language
# for example

list1 = [1,23,4,5,6,7]   # it is a lsit of the 5 values stored in data set list list1
print(list1)

# lets do a another program related to it
for i in list1:
    print(i)     # this will show all of the list data in the sequence

# lets apply different different functions on the list


# for example .append function
# this will add the any value or data at the -1 position of the list 
var = list1.append("tom")
print(list1)
