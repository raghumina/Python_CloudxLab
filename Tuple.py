# tuple in python arte also unordered data collection
# we can store different different type of data in tuple
# tuple is not mutable
# we use ( ) in tuple
# for example

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8)
print(tuple1)

# most of the functions in tuple are similar to the function in list
# even most of them are same and can be used on both data colletions

# for example
print(tuple1.count(8))  # so it will count how many time 8 is repeated in the tuple
