# Problem 2
'''
Define a function with the name special_func which takes an argument num
Initialize a variable total with value 0
Check if num is positive int.
If num is positive int, find out all the factors of that number and return the sum of odd factors i.e.
total of all factors which are odd. (Factors are the numbers you multiply together to get the number equal to num).
For example, the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24. Out of which only 1 and 3 are odd ,
So the total(sum of odd factors) here should be '4'
if num is negative or if the type of num is not int then return -10.

Sample Input:
special_func(12)
special_func(15)
special_func(-1)
special_func('abcd')

Sample Output:
4
24
-10
-10
