# Strings
# a program to find the length of a string
# for example
'''
name = "MESSI"
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(name[i])  # this will return the range of the name
print(len(name))

# more examples
sentence = "what are you doing tom"

# output will be
# "ou doing tom"
# and a before colon means
print(sentence[:3])  # all the values or character before 3
# the output will be
#   "wha"

ord('a')

# the upper case and lower case in strings

# dir(name)  # ????
# print(dir(name))  # it will shows the methods

# lets use some of this methods
print("hello how are you ".split())  # it will split up all the words in the sentence

# we can use other characters also

name = 'Raghu'  # tell weather a string or word is present in string or not

# another example
fruit1 = "apple"

# to remove the whiteapaces from the strings

name = "      hello "

# and the lstrip() and rstrip() used to remove the spaces from the respective sides
# for example
name = "      hello    "
print(name.rstrip())  # remove spaces from right side

print(name.lstrip())  # remove spaces from the left side

# prefixes function
line = "Today is a great day"
print(line.startswith('T'))  # the output will be True

print(line.startswith('t'))  # if we give 't' the output will be False

# to locate the special character or letters we use find functon
# for exampple
